# Passport.js :rocket:

## Purpose :dark_sunglasses:

The purpose of this repository is to have a series of passport.js examples to reference to later.

### How it works :open_book:

1. See if username matches username in db
2. Check if password matches password
3. Check if user has been authenticated already (look at sessions)
   3a. If already logged in, then allow them in
   3b. Otherwise, redirect to login/signup page

### Where it fits :paperclip:

- [ ] Fits into node.js applications that require user authentication

### User Stories :telescope:

1. Users will be able to look through the various examples and understand how to utilize passport.js well.
